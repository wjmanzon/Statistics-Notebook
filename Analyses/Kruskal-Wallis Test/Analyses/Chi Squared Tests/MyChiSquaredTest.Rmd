<!-- Directions

Come up with a chi squared test analysis of your own creation. 

* Write the Background and clearly state your question. Then collect data and perform the chi-squared test analysis in order to answer your question. Use the proper order of first, ask the question, then second, figure out the answer.

* You can use data from 
    - An R data set
    - the internet (like weather data, Facebook data, or sports data) 
    - your own experiment 
    - your own observational study
* However,     
    - Do not violate the "Human Subjects Rules" of the university: http://www.byui.edu/executive-strategy-and-planning/institutional-research/research-and-assessments/research-and-surveys

* You need a sample size large enough to meet the requirements of the chi squared test. Unfortunately, the sample size is completely dependent on the situation you select. A good rule of thumb is 10 observations per "combination-group" in your data.
