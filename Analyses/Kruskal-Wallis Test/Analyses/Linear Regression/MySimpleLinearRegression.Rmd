<!-- Directions

Come up with a simple linear regression of your own creation. 

* Write the Background and clearly state your question. Then collect data and perform the linear regression analysis in order to answer your question. Use the proper order of first, ask the question, then second, figure out the answer.

* You should collect both the quantitative response variable and the quantitative explanatory variable yourself. This can be data you collect from 
    - the internet (like weather data, Facebook data, or sports data) 
    - your own experiment 
    - your own observational study
* However,     
    - The data should not be a single pre-existing dataset. It must be something that you piece together yourself.

* You need at least $n=3$ $(X,Y)$ pairs to perform the regression. However, your regression will only be useful if you can get around $n=10$ or more observations.
